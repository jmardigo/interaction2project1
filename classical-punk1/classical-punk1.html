            <p class="main-text">At the heart of early punk was calculated anger. 
                It was anger at the establishment and anger at the allegedly soft
                rebellion of the hippie counterculture; anger, too, at the commodification
                of rock and roll (Cullen 1996: 249). Its politics were avowedly apolitical,
                yet it openly and explicitly confronted the traditions and norms of the 
                powers that be. Describing the cultural milieu for young people in 1975, 
                Greil Marcus notes the centrality of cultural production: ‘For the young 
                everything flowed from rock ‘n’ roll (fashion, slang, sexual styles, drug
                habits, poses), or was organized by it, or was validated by it.’ But by 
                the early 1970s, with commodification in full swing, with some artists 
                said to have compromised their integrity by becoming rich stars, and 
                with ‘rock’ having been integrated into the mainstream,some people felt 
                that youth subcultures were increasingly a part of the intensifying 
                consumer society, rather than opponents of the mainstream. Punk promised 
                to build a scene that could not be taken. Its anger, pleasures, and ugliness
                were to go beyond what capitalism and bourgeois society could swallow. 
                It would be untouchable, undesirable, unmanageable.

                Early punk was a proclamation and an embrace of discord. In England it was 
                begun by working-class youths decrying a declining economy and rising 
                unemployment, chiding the hypocrisy of the rich, and refuting the notion of 
                reform. In America, early punk was a middle-class youth movement, a reaction 
                against the boredom of mainstream culture. Early punk sought to tear apart 
                consumer goods, royalty, and sociability; and it sought to destroy the idols 
                of the bourgeoisie.
                <br><br>
                At first punk succeeded beyond its own lurid dreams. The Sex Pistols created a 
                fresh moral panic fuelled by British tabloids, Members of Parliament, and plenty
                of everyday folk. Initially, at least, they threatened ‘everything England stands 
                for’: patriotism, class hierarchy, ‘common decency’ and ‘good taste.’ When the 
                Sex Pistols topped the charts in Britain, and climbed high in America, Canada, 
                and elsewhere, punk savoured a moment in the sun: every public castigation only 
                convinced more people that punk was real.

            <p class="caption-left">“Damning God and the state, work and leisure, 
                home and family, sex and play, the audience and itself, the 
                music briefly made it possible to experience all those things as 
                if they were not natural facts but ideological constructs: things 
                than had been made and therefore could be altered, or done away with 
                altogether. It became possible to see these things as bad jokes, 
                and for the music to come forth as a better joke.”

            <p class="main-text">Punk was to cross the rubicon of style from which there
                could be no retreat. Some punks went so far as to valorize anything 
                mainstream society disliked, including rape and death camps; some punks 
                slid into fascism. When the raw forces and ugliness of punk succumbed to 
                corporate-capitalism within a few short years, the music/style nexus had 
                lost its battle of Waterloo. Punk waged an all-out battle on this front, 
                and it wielded new and shocking armaments, but in the end, even punk was 
                proven profitable. Penny Rimbaud traces its cooptation:

            <p class="caption-right">“…within six months the movement had been bought out. The 
                capitalist counter-revolutionaries had killed with cash. Punk degenerated 
                from being a force for change, to becoming just another element in the 
                grand media circus. Sold out, sanitised and strangled, punk had become 
                just another social commodity, a burnt-out memory of how it might have been.”
