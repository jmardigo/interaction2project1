                <p class="main-text">With the death of punk, classical subcultures died. What had, by the 1970s, 
                    emerged as ‘subcultures’ were understood to be groups of youths who practised a wide array 
                    of social dissent through shared behavioural, musical, and costume orientations. Such groups 
                    were remarkably capable vehicles for social change, and were involved in dramatically reshaping 
                    social norms in many parts of the world. These ‘classical’ subcultures obtained their potency partly 
                    through an ability to shock and dismay, to disobey prescribed confines of class, gender, and ethnicity. 
                    But things changed. People gradually became acclimatized to such subcultural transgressions to the 
                    point that, in many places, they have become an expected part of the social landscape. The image of 
                    rebellion has become one of the most dominant narratives of the corporate capitalist landscape: the ‘bad 
                    boy’ has been reconfigured as a prototypical consumer. And so it was a new culture in the 1970s, the 
                    punk subculture, which emerged to fight even the normalization of subculture itself, with brilliant 
                    new forms of social critique and style. But even punk was caught, caged, and placed in the subcultural 
                    zoo, on display for all to see. Torn from its societal jungle and safely taunted by viewers behind 
                    barcodes, punk, the last subculture, was dead.

                <p class="main-text">The classical subculture ‘died’ when it became the object of social inspection and 
                    nostalgia, and when it became so amenable to commodification. Marketers long ago awakened to the fact 
                    that subcultures are expedient vehicles for selling music, cars, clothing, cosmetics, and everything 
                    else under the sun. But this truism is not lost on many subcultural youth themselves, and they will 
                    be the first to grumble that there is nothing new under the subcultural sun. <br> <br>
                    
                    In this climate, constrained by the discourse of subculture, deviation from the norm ain’t what it 
                    used to be. Deviation from the norm seems, well, normal. It is allegedly common for a young person to
                    choose a prefab subculture off the rack, wear it for a few years, then rejoin with the ‘mainstream’ 
                    culture that they never really left at all. Perhaps the result of our autopsy will show that subculture 
                    (of the young, dissident, costumed kind) has become a useful part of the status quo, and less useful 
                    for harbouring discontent. For these reasons we can melodramatically pronounce that subculture is dead.<br> <br>
            
                    Yet still they come: goths, neo-hippies, and ’77-ish mohawked punk rockers. And still people find solidarity, 
                    revolt, and individuality by inhabiting a shared costume marking their membership in a subculture. And still 
                    parents get upset, people gawk, peers shudder, and selves are recreated. Perhaps it is cruel or inaccurate 
                    to call these classical motifs dead, because they can be so very alive and real to the people who occupy 
                    them. Like squatters in abandoned buildings, practising subcultists give life to what seem to be <br>deceased structures.

                    Is Subculture Dead?

                    The death of subculture – that is, the death of subcultural autonomy and meaningful rebellion – did not escape the 
                    notice of many. For decades people have decried the commercialization of style, the paisley without the politics. 
                    But such laments have not failed to produce strategies. There is something else – another kind of subculture, gestating 
                    and growing far below the classical subcultural terrain. For two decades thousands kept a secret: punk never died. 
                    Instead, punk had, even in its earliest days, begun to articulate a social form that anticipates and outmanoeuvres the
                    dominance of corporate-capitalism. And as the Cold War finally disappears from decades of habit, and as the political 
                    and cultural hegemony of corporate-capitalism seems unrivalled, it suddenly becomes clear that the anarchist frameworks 
                    of punk have spread into all sorts of social groupings. The social forms punks began to play with in the early 1970s 
                    have penetrated subcultures across the spectrum. After the death of the classical subculture we witness the birth of new 
                    practices, ideologies, and ways of being – a vast litter of anarchism. <br> <br>

                    For tribes of contemporary people who might be called punk (and who often refuse to label themselves), their subculture 
                    is partly in revolt from the popular discourse of subculture, from what has become, in punk eyes, a commercialized form of 
                    safe, affected discontent – a series of consumed subjectivities, including pre-fabricated ‘Alternative’ looks. Punk is, 
                    ironically, a subculture operating within parts of that established discourse, and yet it is also subculture partly dedicated 
                    to opposing what the discourse of subculture has become. As the century rolls over, punk is the invention of not just new 
                    subjectivities but, perhaps, a new kind of cultural formation. The death of subculture has in some ways helped to produce
                    one of the most formidable subcultures yet: the death of subculture is the (re)birth of punk.
